# Fuzzy_logic
Fuzzy logic is widely used, however it is hardly noticeable.
In this project we have speed and fuel consumption - and calculations with surprising result.
How fuel consumption will grow with rising speed?

Fuzzy logic is a form of many-valued logic in which the truth values of variables may be any real number between 0 and 1 inclusive. 
It is employed to handle the concept of partial truth, where the truth value may range between completely true and completely false. 
By contrast, in Boolean logic, the truth values of variables may only be the integer values 0 or 1.
